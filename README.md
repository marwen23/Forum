# Forum

The main Idea of this project is to create an online platform where users can discuss several subject according to their interests and exchange information about the latest entertaining contents worldwide. This Forum allow surfers to interact with topics in different ways: they can search for a specific content through an advanced research system, rate a movie or a TV show and give their reviews in the comment section so other visitors can read the userâ€™s feedbacks and get an overview. The app will also provide its users with an open space forum where they can post and discuss random threads. The forum contents are indexed by categories, each category is administrated by a single moderator who is responsible of managing the content within this category as well as running activities within the section; delete an appropriate comment or even react to some of them.
